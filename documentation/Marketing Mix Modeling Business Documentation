# Marketing Mix Model (MMM) Documentation

## Executive Summary

Our Marketing Mix Model is a powerful analytical tool designed to help businesses understand and optimize their marketing investments. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques, we provide clear insights into how different marketing channels contribute to revenue generation.

## Key Terms Explained (Non-Technical Version)

### Marketing Analytics Terms
- **Marketing Mix Model**: A method to understand how different marketing activities impact sales
- **Elasticity**: How sensitive sales are to changes in marketing spend
- **Adstock Effect**: The lasting impact of marketing activities over time
- **Channel**: A specific marketing method (e.g., TV ads, digital marketing, social media)

### Statistical Terms Made Simple
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: A mathematical method that helps us find the best way to draw a line through data points to understand relationships
- **R-Squared**: A score that tells us how well our model explains changes in sales (ranges from 0 to 1)
- **Diminishing Returns**: When spending more money on marketing provides less and less additional benefit
- **Multicollinearity**: When marketing channels are very similar in their effects, making it hard to understand individual impacts

## Methodology Overview

### Core Analytical Approach: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

We use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression as our primary statistical method. Think of OLS like drawing the most accurate line through a scatter plot that minimizes the distance between the line and each data point. This helps us understand how marketing spend relates to revenue.

### Advanced Analytical Techniques

#### 1. Adstock Transformations: Capturing Marketing Memory

Adstock transformations are crucial for understanding how marketing efforts continue to influence consumer behavior over time. They recognize that marketing doesn't have an immediate, one-time effect but creates a lasting impact.

**Types of Adstock Transformations**

1. **Geometric Adstock**
   - **Definition**: A classic exponential decay model that assumes marketing impact diminishes consistently over time
   - **How It Works**:
     * Assigns progressively lower weights to past marketing activities
     * Recent marketing spend has the highest impact
     * Impact decays exponentially with each time period
   - **Best Used For**:
     * Channels with relatively quick, predictable impact
     * Traditional media with moderate carryover effects
   - **Example**: Television advertising, where initial exposure has the strongest effect

2. **Weibull Adstock**
   - **Definition**: A flexible transformation that can model more complex marketing response patterns
   - **How It Works**:
     * Uses a probability distribution to model marketing impact
     * Can create S-shaped response curves
     * Allows for delayed peak effects
   - **Strengths**:
     * Captures nuanced marketing dynamics
     * Handles channels with non-linear, delayed impacts
   - **Best Used For**:
     * Digital marketing campaigns
     * Social media efforts with cumulative effects
     * Channels with complex response patterns

3. **Delayed Adstock**
   - **Definition**: A transformation that explicitly models a lag between marketing spend and its peak impact
   - **How It Works**:
     * Sets a specific delay before marketing spend reaches maximum effectiveness
     * Allows peak impact to occur after an initial lag period
   - **Ideal For**:
     * B2B marketing with longer decision cycles
     * High-consideration purchase channels
     * Marketing efforts with inherent time delays in consumer response

#### 2. Model Specifications: Choosing the Right Analytical Lens

1. **Linear-Linear Model**
   - **Description**: Traditional model where both input and output are in original units
