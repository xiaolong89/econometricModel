- Basic documentation

### Tasks:
1. **Codebase Assessment (2 days)**
   - Identify critical paths in basic_mmm.py
   - Map data flows and dependencies
   - Document current limitations

2. **API Definition (2 days)**
   - Define clear input/output contracts
   - Create endpoint specifications for Bubble integration
   - Establish data exchange formats

3. **Critical Fixes (1 day)**
   - Address deprecation warnings
   - Fix any blocking issues
   - Improve error handling for key functions

## Phase 2: Integration Layer Development (1.5 weeks)

**Key Deliverables:**
- Backend API endpoints
- Data processing middleware

- Deployment documentation

### Tasks:
1. **End-to-End Integration (3 days)**
   - Connect Bubble UI to backend APIs
   - Test data flow through entire system
   - Validate visualization output

2. **Essential Testing (1 day)**
   - Perform smoke testing
   - Validate core functionality
   - Test with representative data

3. **Deployment Preparation (1 day)**
   - Create deployment checklist
   - Document configuration requirements
   - Prepare rollback procedures

## Phase 5: Deployment & Launch (1 week)

**Key Deliverables:**

   - Launch Bubble UI
   - Verify system operation

3. **Documentation & Handoff (2 days)**
   - Create user guides
   - Document known limitations
   - Establish support channels

## Post-MVP Priorities

The following items should be addressed after MVP launch:

1. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Implement comprehensive test suite
   - Add automated testing to CI/CD

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identify bottlenecks from real usage
   - Optimize high-impact functions

3. **Feature Expansion**
   - Add advanced model options
   - Enhance visualization capabilities

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Performance issues with large datasets | Set clear size limitations in documentation; add progress indicators |
| Integration challenges between Python and Bubble | Allocate buffer time; create simplified API contracts |
| Model accuracy concerns | Document limitations; provide interpretation guidelines |
| User adoption barriers | Focus on intuitive UI; create walkthrough guides |

## Timeline Overview

Total estimated timeline: **6.5 weeks** to MVP launch

This timeline assumes dedicated resources and minimal scope changes. A contingency buffer of 1-2 weeks is recommended for unforeseen challenges.

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:
1. Users can upload marketing data and configure basic parameters
2. The system generates meaningful marketing mix insights
3. Results can be visualized and exported
4. The solution can handle expected data volumes with acceptable performance
